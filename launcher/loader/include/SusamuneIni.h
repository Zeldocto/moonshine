/*

Susamune launcher settings, loader side.

The [nintendont] section of moonshine.ini holds everything the launcher GUI
edits: which game version to boot, where each version's disc image lives, and
the handful of Nintendont options that used to live in nincfg.bin. nincfg.bin
is gone -- the kernel takes NIN_CFG through the MEM2 handoff, so the file was
only ever loader-side persistence, and keeping it would have meant two files
disagreeing about the same options.

Reads and writes go to the device the launcher was run from, never the game's
device. The kernel mounts that device as drive 1 when the two differ, so there
is exactly one moonshine.ini no matter where the ISO lives.

The other sections belong to the mod ([settings_<region>], [binds_<region>])
and are copied through untouched, which is the mirror image of what the kernel
does to this section in SusamuneCfg.c.
